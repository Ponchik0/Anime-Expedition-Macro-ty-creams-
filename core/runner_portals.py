"""Portals: a mode-agnostic way to search for and activate a portal.

The Event kind reaches its portal picker through the event gamemode (see
EventOps._select_summer_portal). This mixin is the OTHER lead-in: from the
lobby, open the Inventory (nav_inv), switch to the Portals tab
(normal_portals_nav), and land on the same portal picker. The picker
selection itself is agnostic -- it drives off the PORTAL_SEARCHES regions
(search box + the portal-card list) so it works however the picker was
opened.
